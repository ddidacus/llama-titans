## Titans - Pytorch (wip)

Unofficial implementation of [Titans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663) in Pytorch. Will also contain some explorations into architectures beyond their simple 1-4 layer MLP for the neural memory module, if it works well to any degree.

## Appreciation

- [Eryk](https://github.com/sentialx) for sharing his early experimental results with me, positive for 2 layer MLP

## Install

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```python
from llama_titans import TitanLlamaModel
model = TitanLlamaModel.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B", gated=True) # Memory as Gate (MAG)
model = TitanLlamaModel.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B", gated=False) # Memory as Layer (MAL)
```
